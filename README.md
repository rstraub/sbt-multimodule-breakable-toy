# ðŸ§¸ SBT Multimodule Breakable Toy

Small repo to experiment with SBT and a multimodule setup.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- [x] Add multiple modules
- [x] Setup dependencies between the modules
- [x] Setup a dependency on test jar between modules
- [x] Apply standard setup for modules (such as Scalatest)
- [x] Specifying main classes to run the application from the command line
- [ ] Find SBT equivalents for plugins
  - Scalastyle (actually doesn't seem to have great support)
  - Scalafmt + Scalafix (seems to be the new standard)

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

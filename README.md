# ðŸ§¸ SBT Multimodule Breakable Toy

Small repo to experiment with SBT and a multimodule setup.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

- Add multiple modules
- Setup dependencies between the modules
- Setup a dependency on test jar between modules
- Apply standard setup for modules (such as Scalatest)
- Specifying main classes to run the application from the command line
- Find SBT equivalents for plugins
    - Scalastyle (actually doesn't seem to have great support)
    - Scalafmt + Scalafix (seems to be the new standard)

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned
